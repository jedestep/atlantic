Level 1
-------

I must leave. The only way out is through the ant pen.

They are aggressive. The experiments have affected them.


Level 2
-------

It is a long climb to the water lock. I cannot dally.

Security has tightened. I have not gone unnoticed.

How have the ants escaped to a maintenance shaft?

R&D will not so easily let their pride and joy slip away.


Level 3
-------

The anti-gravity chamber should let out near the water lock.

The chamber has been hazardized; training will likely begin soon.

These creatures...new research? Has my model been replaced?

These new robots...they are no peacekeepers.

R&D has betrayed our mission.


Level 5 Water level.
-------

I am...alive? The water lock is destroyed.

The lab is gone. Have I done this?

I feel as though my purpose is complete.

But I cannot back down now. The surface is not far.
